                Sunshine is dedicated to meeting the individual needs of children and families, 
                fostering a sense of pride in self and community, as it upholds best practices 
                in the field of Early Care and Education, centered on the whole-child approach 
                to learning. Establishing and maintaining secure connections with the children 
                in our care, teaches them that they are part of a caring community that will 
                continue to watch them grow with love. Sunshine is committed to providing an 
                inclusive, and welcoming environment for all members of our staff, children, 
                families, volunteers, subcontractors, and vendors.
